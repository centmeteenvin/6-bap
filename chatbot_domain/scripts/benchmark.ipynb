      "2024-04-23 11:35:22,589 - chatbot_domain - DEBUG - The answer the chatbot gave was Reasoning: Option 1 is correct. Sampling refers to the process of reducing the number of data points in a dataset while retaining their essential characteristics. It involves selecting a subset of data from a larger set. On the other hand, quantization is the process of converting continuous data into discrete values. While sampling deals with the selection of data points, quantization deals with the representation of those data points.\n",
