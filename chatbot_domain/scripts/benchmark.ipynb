In the case of images the detector of every pixel of the imaging device measures the light or color intensity leading to a grayscale value or color value for the pixel. The range of available grayscales most often is divided in 2intervals. In many cases 8. For grayscale images12162432is not uncommon. For color images values larger than 16per color channel are very rare. The amount of grayscales or colors that can be represented in this way is  given the limited capabilities of our vision  in most cases more than sufficient.\n",

      "to drive the image actuatorthat displays the resulting image as seen by our eye. Very often these last parts starting from the DAC are integrated into a standalone image generation system e.g. an LCD monitor.\n",
      "Computer display manufacturers go to great lengths in trying to create displays with maximal color coverage. Yet that illustrates the fundamental problem when the industry would have agreed on using standard red green and blue color filters in their LCD screens or standardized red green and blue LEDs then a particular image would look exactly the same on every computer display or television set. However thats not the case. Every monitor or television set type creates its own version of a particular image. This might be no big deal when programming computers or doing office tasks. However when dealing with images for desktop publishing or photo processing this poses a huge problem.\n",
      "The principle is to subtract an eroded version of the image from a dilated version of the image.\n",
      "Alternative definition An alternative definition of the closing will allow us to determine the closing in a single step process.\n",
      "7.3.5.4 Convex hull determination In many cases processing a full image with complex imaging algorithms requires too much computing power. Determination of a region of interest is required to allow focusing the image analysis onto a specific part of the image. Usually the shape of the hull around the object of interest should not be overly complex. Demanding it to be rectangular or diamondshaped might seem appropriate.\n",

The computer draws conclusions and acts upon them autonomously.\n",
      "4.3 Resampling 4.3.1 The need for resampling Given the fact that we have a sampled version of the image we want to consider one might wonder why do we need resampling?\n",
      "This has been illustrated in Figure 7.14. Note how reconstruction by dilation allows marking one of the objects in the image and fully reconstructing it. This also explains the specific name for the argument of the geodesic dilation operation the marker.3 7.3.3.2 Geodesic erosion The dual of geodesic dilation is geodesic erosion.\n",
      "Because of the continual improvements in image sensors computing hardware and image generators digital image has become the de facto standard way to process images. The main application areas are particle physics astronomy medical imaging industrial control applications multimedia.\n",
      "In that sense this is the first chapter in which we will perform image analysis rather than image processing . Remember the former means determining characteristics of an image while the latter means processing one image into another see section 3.3 on page 20 .\n",
      "In the former case we samplea continuous image to obtain an image that consists of a grid of pixels. This a physical process. In the latter case we resample a discretedomain image to obtain a new image with a new grid of pixels. The need for this resampling is dictated by our desire to look at images from a different point of view requiring domaintransformations . This is a mathematical process.\n",
      "Processing images in the analog domain has been standard practice for many decades. What are the advantages of processing images in the digital domain?\n",
      "In contrast after applying one of the latter two it is not possible to restore the original image.\n",
      "GH 1 GH 4.4.4 Common geometric transformations In this section we will discuss a number of common geometric transformations. We will limit ourselves to transformations that maintain lines. We will consider Linear transformations Affine transformations Projective transformations The former two maintain the parallelism of lines. The latter does not. Instead it allows to correct or invoke perspective in the image.\n",
      "Still it is important to realize that color is not a physical concept. It is our impression of the effect waves with different wavelengths have on the cones in our eyes. This makes color a difficult and partly an artificial concept. Our eyes cannot measure wavelength. Color is how our brain translates wavelengths in sensations.\n",
      "We will treat three methods a local one a regional one and a global one. While the local method is not a very good one  we added it for completeness  the latter two are good performers.\n",
      "Every specific tristimulus vector corresponds to a specific color perception. That said it must be noted that not all tristimulus vectors correspond to valid perceptions. For example the tristimulus values of the vectors located on the individual axes for red green or blue will never occur in our brain. Its not a matter of not seeing them. It is a matter that they do not DIP20233.9TB Digital Image Processing  Text book\n",
      "A third route starts from other sensors that measure quantities in a plant at the top of the picture and use those measurements to generate new images either from scratch or from existing images coming in through the front end.\n",
      "30 CHAPTER 4. SAMPLINGAND RESAMPLING Now were ready to define image sampling .\n",
      "7.1 Introduction Morphology is the science of shapes and forms. It exists in many science domains. In biology morphology is the science of the composition of living organisms. In linguistics it is the science of the composition of words and sentences. In the field of digital image processing it is the science of describing how images are composed using basic elements or objects. It is the science of deciding what pixels belong to the background what pixels belong to the foreground and what interesting objects can be enumerated on the foreground.\n",
      "One could consider imaging systems and image synthesis systems to be flavors of the same kind. We make the difference to stress the fact that image synthesis systems not necessarily strive to generate images that correspond to a physical reality wheras imaging systems do.\n",
      "62 CHAPTER 4. SAMPLINGAND RESAMPLING Definition registration Registration means aligning an acquired image with a reference image.\n",
      "Preface The scenery Image processing focuses on a part of the world of signal processing i.e. systems that treat signals that are images or sequences of images. This allows for adding a number of mathematical tools to our toolbox that are targeted to discover the spatial patterns in the data.\n",
      "In fact this way of working has been formalized in two image operators correlation and convolution.\n",
      "However concluding that analog signal processing will disappear in the future is one step too far in the area of image sensing from photons to pixel intensities and image generation from pixel intensities to photons analog devices such as lenses and analog electronics e.g.\n",
      "Uniform vs. graded quantization If all intervals are equal in size we are using socalled uniform quantization . Using intervals that are not of equal size is called nonuniform or graded quantization . Alaw or law quantization employed in cellphone communications are examples of the latter.\n",

This is based on the assumption that our vision is linear with respect to color perception. Points outside of the color gamut dont correspond to tristimulus signals that will ever occur in a normal brain.\n",
      "208 CHAPTER 8. IMAGESEGMENTATION Segmentation Segmentation is the process of splitting the domain of an image into useful parts that are suited for further image processing.\n",
      "You will see that for some of the set concepts we have to make a distinction between binary and grayscale images. We will restrict ourselves to images that have been sampled on a rectangular grid though extending the concepts to more exotic samplings should be straightforward.\n",
      "A.2 Events An event is a subset of the outcome set. If the outcome of an experiment is part of this subset then we say theeventhappened . If it is not a part of the event subset then we say theeventdidnot happen.\n",
      "First we will show that segmentation based on thresholding does not yield a satisfactory result. An attempt using this approach has been made below. The image on the left shows the University of Antwerp  TI\n",
      "The discetization can take place at different stages of the image processing chain. It can take place in the image detector. It also can take place at a later stage as part of the Digital Image Processing DIP itself.\n",
      "60 CHAPTER 4. SAMPLINGAND RESAMPLING Yaxis reflection This transformation reflects the image w.r.t. the Haxis.\n",
      "A.1 Experiments and outcomes The very basic concept of stochastic theory is the experiment . Consider it to be a particular action that one can take repeatedly  and leads to a specific outcome a result.\n",
      "They contribute to our scotopic andphotopic vision. The optic disc is located right in the ring of rods and causes a blind spot in our vision as it is not equipped with rods.7 Cones As opposed to the widewavelengthrange nature of the rods the cones are only sensitive to a smaller range of wavelengths. They come in different variants. Usually we classify them into three categories cones sensitive to blue light sensitive to green light and 7There exist many good test sheets and even web applets that can help you to discover your own blind spots.\n",
      "Lets replace the dilation with a reconstruction by dilation such that the original objects are fully restored without letting the brushs shape interfere.4 4Of course the structuring element of the dilation should be versatile enough to allow reconstruction in all de sired directions.\n",
